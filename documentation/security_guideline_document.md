# WorkLifeBalance_Andy Security Guidelines

This document provides comprehensive security best practices tailored to the WorkLifeBalance_Andy desktop application. It aligns with core principles like Security by Design, Least Privilege, and Defense in Depth, ensuring that the app remains robust against common threats and vulnerabilities.

---

## 1. Security by Design & Secure Defaults

- Adopt a threat-modeling mindset from day one. Regularly identify and review potential attack paths (e.g., Electron IPC misuse, file-system access).
- Ship with the most restrictive configuration:
  - Disable Node.js integration in renderer processes (set `nodeIntegration: false`).
  - Enable Content Security Policy (CSP) to allow only local resources and disallow inline scripts/styles.
  - Default to HTTPS-wrapped webviews (if any remote content is needed).
- Embed security checks into the CI/CD pipeline (lint rules, dependency scans) so vulnerabilities are caught early.

## 2. Access Control & Privilege Separation

- Run the application under an unprivileged OS user context; do not request elevated (root/Administrator) permissions unless absolutely necessary.
- Inter-process Communication (IPC):
  - Expose only minimal, well-defined channels between main and renderer processes.
  - Validate and sanitize all incoming arguments in the main process before performing any actions (file reads/writes, shell commands).
  - Use a whitelist of IPC message names and strictly enforce parameter types.

## 3. Input Validation & Output Encoding

- Treat every user-provided configuration value (durations, activity names) as untrusted. Validate on the main process:
  - Duration fields: ensure numeric, within allowed ranges (e.g., 1–480 minutes).
  - Activity names: enforce reasonable length limits and disallow control characters.
- Never interpolate user data directly into HTML templates. Instead:
  - Use a safe templating engine or React with automatic DOM encoding.
  - Sanitize any HTML content if custom themes or rich text are supported in future.

## 4. Secure File I/O & Data Persistence

- Store user data and history under the user’s AppData (Windows) or home directory with restricted file permissions (mode 600 or equivalent).
- Prevent file corruption and race conditions:
  - Write to a temporary file, fsync, then atomically rename to the final path.
  - Wrap SQLite writes in transactions. Use PRAGMA integrity checks on startup.
- Guard against path traversal:
  - Do not accept arbitrary file paths from the renderer. Always resolve relative paths against the application’s data directory.

## 5. Electron-Specific Hardening

- Disable or restrict features that could enable code injection:
  - `webPreferences.contextIsolation: true`
  - `webPreferences.enableRemoteModule: false`
- Enforce a strict CSP in your HTML host page, for example:
  ```html
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self';" />
  ```
- Avoid `eval()`, new Function(), or dynamic script loading. If absolutely required, document the justification and isolate in a sandbox.

## 6. Dependency Management & Supply Chain Security

- Use lockfiles (`package-lock.json`) to fix dependency versions. Audit dependencies regularly with `npm audit`, Snyk, or similar tools.
- Vet third-party libraries for active maintenance, known exploits, and minimal feature sets. Remove unused modules.
- Pin critical dependencies (Electron, React, SQLite driver) to specific secure versions. Monitor for CVE disclosures.

## 7. Secure Audio & Media Handling

- Load audio assets from the application bundle only. Do not accept remote URLs or filesystem paths provided by users.
- Validate file format and size at build time. Avoid runtime decoders for untrusted codecs.
- Fallback gracefully on playback failures without exposing stack traces or internal paths to the UI.

## 8. Logging & Error Handling

- Log high-level events (startup, shutdown, IPC errors) to a local log file with restricted access. Do not log sensitive user data or file paths in production.
- Present user-friendly error messages. Avoid exposing call stacks or internal file locations in dialogs.
- In case of corrupted settings or database files, offer only safe recovery actions (restore defaults, retry).

## 9. Secure CI/CD & Releases

- Integrate automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) and static analysis into your GitHub Actions or equivalent pipeline.
- Sign installers and application bundles to prevent tampering.
- Strip debug symbols and disable development flags in production builds.

## 10. Future Considerations & Monitoring

- If a cloud sync feature is added in later versions:
  - Enforce TLS 1.2+ with strong cipher suites.
  - Implement OAuth or API-key based authentication with proper key rotation.
  - Rate-limit requests to protect against abuse.
- Periodically review the application’s security posture, especially after upgrading major frameworks or introducing new features.
- Maintain an incident response plan outlining how to handle discovered vulnerabilities and user disclosures.

By embedding these guidelines into your design, implementation, and release processes, WorkLifeBalance_Andy will achieve a strong security posture while preserving usability and performance. Always prioritize simple, auditable security controls and continuously evolve defenses as the threat landscape changes.
